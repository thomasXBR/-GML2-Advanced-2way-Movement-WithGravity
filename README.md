# -Advanced 2 way movement with gravity in GML2 code for 2D games
For this GML2 project I named the player sprites and object as "spr_player", "spr_player_walk", "spr_walk_left" and "obj_player";
<br>
<br>
The sprite and object for the ground are "spr_gnd" and "obj_gnd";
<br>
<br>
You may name these however you please.
